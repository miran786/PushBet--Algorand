# Summary 5.5: Civic Sense Reporting & Resolving

## Objective
Improve the Civic Sense Arena to allow reporting "messy" areas and simulate a resolution flow.

## Accomplishments
- **Reporting**: Added a "Report for Cleaning" button in `CivicArena.tsx` that triggers when AI detects a messy area.
- **Admin Resolve**: Added a hidden "[ADMIN] FORCE RESOLVE" button to simulate an admin marking a reported issue as clean.
- **UI States**: Implemented dynamic UI states for "ISSUE REPORTED" and "ADMIN RESOLVED" with unique icons and colors.
- **Veracity**: Simulated a ticket system (Ticket #2026-PB-99) for reported items.

## Files Modified
- [CivicArena.tsx](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/src/app/pages/CivicArena.tsx)

## Verification Results
- Verified that "messy" detections allow for reporting.
- Verified that reporting updates the UI to "Notified".
- Verified that Force Resolve correctly transitions the state back to "Clean".
