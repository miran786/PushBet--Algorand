# Summary 5.4: NFT Badges & DB Reset (Student 1-4)

## Objective
Reset the database with generic test users and implement NFT badge rewards.

## Accomplishments
- **DB Seeding**: Updated `server/seed-db.js` to create "Student 1" through "Student 4" with specific roles.
- **NFT Badges**: Implemented backend logic to award badges (`PUSHUP_MASTER`, `CLEAN_CONTRIBUTOR`) and frontend profile integration to display them.

## Files Modified
- [seed-db.js](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/server/seed-db.js)
- [Profile.tsx](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/src/app/pages/Profile.tsx)

## Verification Results
- Database successfully reset with new seed data.
- Profile correctly displays earned badges as NFTs.
