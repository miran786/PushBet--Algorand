# Summary 5.8: Marketplace (Seller Photos & AI Negotiation)

## Objective
Enforce seller photo uploads in the Marketplace and implement an AI-driven negotiation chat using Gemini.

## Accomplishments
- **Photo Enforcement**: Updated `handleMintAndList` in `Marketplace.tsx` to require an image URL. Added a "Verified Photo" badge to all listings.
- **AI Negotiation**: Integrated Gemini AI into a new chat modal. Users can negotiate prices with an automated seller persona that can agree on a final price.
- **UI/UX**: Added a "Negotiate" (Robot icon) button to listing cards and implemented a modern chat interface with typing indicators.

## Files Modified
- [Marketplace.tsx](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/src/app/pages/Marketplace.tsx)

## Verification Results
- Verified that listing without a photo is blocked.
- Verified AI chat correctly responds to user offers and attempts to reach a deal.
- Verified the chat modal UI is responsive and functional.
