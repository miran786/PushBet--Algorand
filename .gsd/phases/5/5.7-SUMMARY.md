# Summary 5.7: Commute Pool (VIT Pune & Geolocation)

## Objective
Fix the destination for Commute Pool to VIT Pune and optimize geolocation scanning during the trip.

## Accomplishments
- **Destination**: Set `VIT_COORDS` as the fixed target and updated UI labels to explicitly mention "VIT Pune College".
- **Geolocation**: Replaced `getCurrentPosition` with `watchPosition` for continuous tracking during active trips.
- **Distance Tracking**: Implemented `haversineDistance` logic to update a live "Distance Left" display on the map overlay.
- **Automation**: Added a check to auto-prompt for arrival verification when the user is within 100 meters of the destination.

## Files Modified
- [CommuteArena.tsx](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/src/app/pages/CommuteArena.tsx)

## Verification Results
- Map correctly recenters on user movement.
- Distance display updates in real-time.
- Verified VIT Pune is marked as the target on the map.
