# Summary 5.3: Partner Staking & Player Selection

## Objective
Enable users to select a partner when in PARTNER mode in the Fitness Arena.

## Accomplishments
- **Stake Dialog**: Updated `src/app/components/StakeDialog.tsx` to include a partner selection dropdown when `mode === 'PARTNER'`.
- **Logic**: Updated `handleStake` to include the selected partner in the transaction note content.
- **UI/UX**: Added "CO-OP CHALLENGE" branding and potential split win calculation for the partner mode.

## Files Modified
- [StakeDialog.tsx](file:///d:/GIT/PushBet--Algorand/src/app/components/StakeDialog.tsx)

## Verification Results
- Verified that the partner selection dropdown appears only in PARTNER mode.
- Verified that the stake note content dynamically updates based on the selected partner.
