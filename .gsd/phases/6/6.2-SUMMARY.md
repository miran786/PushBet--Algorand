# Summary: Plan 6.2 — Frontend AI-Governed Marketplace UI

## What Was Done
- Completely rewrote `Marketplace.tsx` (~360 lines) — transformed from NFT buy/sell to AI-governed need-based marketplace
- Updated `Dashboard.tsx` marketplace card description
- Fixed all lint errors (removed unused imports/variables)

## UI Sections
1. **Header**: "AI MARKETPLACE" with brain icon + two tabs
2. **Post a Need**: Chat-style interface → describe need → AI generates contract terms → review & post
3. **Browse Needs**: Grid of need cards with category badges, rewards, AI terms, time remaining
4. **Proof Submission**: Modal with description textarea, image upload, and AI verification result display

## Verification
- TypeScript: ✅ `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- Lint: ✅ All lint errors resolved
