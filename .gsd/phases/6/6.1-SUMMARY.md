# Summary: Plan 6.1 — Backend API & MongoDB Models

## What Was Done
- Created `Need.js` model (requesterWallet, description, reward, status, category, aiTerms, expiresAt)
- Created `Claim.js` model (needId, claimerWallet, proofDescription, proofImage, aiVerified, aiConfidence, aiReason)
- Created `marketplaceController.js` with 5 endpoints + Gemini AI integration
- Created `marketplaceRoutes.js` wiring all routes
- Mounted routes in `server.js` as `/api/marketplace`
- Installed `@google/generative-ai` on server
- Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` to server `.env`

## Endpoints
| Method | Path | Function |
|--------|------|----------|
| POST | /api/marketplace/needs | Create need with AI terms |
| GET | /api/marketplace/needs | List open needs |
| GET | /api/marketplace/needs/:id | Get need + claims |
| POST | /api/marketplace/needs/:id/claim | Claim a need |
| POST | /api/marketplace/needs/:id/submit-proof | Submit & verify proof |

## Verification
- POST /needs: ✅ Returns `success: true` with AI-generated terms
- GET /needs: ✅ Returns list of needs
